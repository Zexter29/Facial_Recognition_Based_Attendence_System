# Face Recognition Based Attendance System

A Python-based attendance system that uses face recognition to automatically mark attendance with date and time. The project includes a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter and ensures secure registration and organized record management.

## 📌 Overview

This system captures facial data of registered users, trains a recognition model, and marks attendance when a face is recognized through a live camera feed. Attendance records are stored in CSV files and displayed live on the GUI.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated attendance using face recognition  
- Interactive and easy-to-use Tkinter GUI  
- Password-protected student registration  
- Daily attendance CSV file generation  
- Live attendance display (ID, Name, Date, Time)  
- Accurate and organized data storage  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI Development)  
- OpenCV (Face Detection & Recognition)  
- LBPH Face Recognizer  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- CSV, datetime  

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Register a new student with ID and name  
2. Capture facial images for training  
3. Train the LBPH face recognition model  
4. Start attendance mode  
5. System recognizes faces and marks attendance automatically  

## 📁 Output Files

- Student details stored in CSV format  
- New attendance file created every day  
- Attendance marked with proper date and time  

## 🎯 Applications

- Colleges and universities  
- Schools and training institutes  
- Small organizations  

## 📌 Note

Ensure proper lighting conditions for better face recognition accuracy.
